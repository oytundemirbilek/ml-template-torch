Plugging-in/out datasets, ablated models, loss functions etc. are often very time-consuming due to structural differences between different implementations. Here there are some bundled functions and classes that are most used for torch-based machine learning projects to organize benchmarking process and save time.

Feel free to open issues and pull requests.
